# ExplorersVision
Configurable dynamic map explortation radius based on environmental visibility factors with optional configuration syncing if on server.

For managing configuration setting you can use an in-game configuration manager or 
change configs by editing the config file on disk as this mod has a built in file watcher.

## Features
- Configurable base exploration radius while on land.
- Configurable base exploration radius while on a boat.
- Configurable effects from the environment:
    - Radius increases gradually based on altitude.
    - Radius increases or decreases based on current amount of daylight.
    - Radius can be decreased by weather effects such as fog, rain or snow.
    - Radius decreased by 30% while in a forested area by default.
    - See config for details on adjust each of these options.

Generally speaking, I reccomend only adjusting the radius values in the "Global" section of the config. 
Default values in the "Multipliers" category have been tuned to approximate actual visibility changes, 
and changing them can significantly impact exploration radius in sometimes unexpected ways.
